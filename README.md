Period 7<br>

Mission Gnocchi<br>
<br>
Project description:</b><br>
You are put into the shoes of a secret agent tasked with the diffcult mission of unlocking an enemy computer to unlock sensitive information.<br>
<br>
<b>To compile/run:</b><br>
The G4P library is needed for the passcode functions to work.<br>
The Minim (2.2.2) library is needed for the audio.<br>
To run, open the file up in processing and press run.<br>
<br>
<b>How to use it:</b>
Upon running the program, you are prompted to complete a tutorial, in which you click the mouse to move to the next scene. <br>
At one of the tutorial scenes, you are able to fill out a certificate of authenticity to become a secret agent.<br>
Your mission is given to you in a message from Agent P -- you must unlock an enemy computer. <br>
Once you complete the tutorial, you will see an interactive desktop simulation. <br>
You can click on the folder icons and open up files and games.<br>
Some folders / files / games require a secret passcode, which can be obtained from winning a game.<br>
After unlocking the final file, you will receive a final message from the owner of the computer -- woah!<br>
<br>
