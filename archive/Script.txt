Agent <codeName>, you made it through. It's about time. I have been waiting for so long.

<name>, I am your father.

You see, when you were a wee child, I was taken captive because of my immense knowledge and intelligence.

They have kept me trapped for years, keeping me from any method of contacting you.

If you are reading this, then I am already dead. I'm gone, but at least my dying wish has been fulfilled.

I knew the risk. I knew that I wouldn't make it out alive when I "dropped" this computer on your agency's ground.

I needed to get across to you, at any cost. I knew only someone of my own blood would be able to unlock my files.

Well done, <name>. Agent <codeName>, I am insanely proud of you. But what I went through all this trouble for was to tell you...

I love you, <name>.

THE END
